# Mobile Haskell Introduction

Haskell is a great language for writing reliable and complex code.  It also has
it's strength in refactoring, where type-guided refactoring can help rewrite
code easily.

This can make it a good choice for building sophisticated business logic.

However Haskell is not known for being particularly friendly to deploy anywhere
outside of server environments as services.

This website's goal is to change this, and illustrate how we can use Haskell for
mobile, and desktop applications, as well as for building applications to run on
Single Board Computers (SBCs) like the Raspberry Pi and others.

A large focus of this side is therefore dedicated to highlighting the cross
compilation capabilities the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) has gained over the
years.

Let's jump into a quick tutorial and build a simple library we can then use in
a mobile application.
